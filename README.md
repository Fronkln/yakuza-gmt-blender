# Terms of Use
By using this tool, you agree to the following:

**I understand that**
- I have to credit this tool and its author(s) whenever I **publish** content that was created using the tool, **partially** or fully.
- I have to credit this tool whenever I **publish** footage of content **I** created using the tool, if the main purpose of that **footage** is to showcase that content.
- I can credit this tool just by posting a **link** to it on the main page of my **mod**/content in a **publicly visible** location, while mentioning its **name** and author(s).
- If I **do not** credit this tool, I cannot **release** **mods**/footage that I created using the tool.
- **Only** in the case I do not publish/**post** any mods/**footage** I created using this tool, I do not have to credit the tool.

### If you do not agree to any of these terms, then you are not allowed to use this tool.

While these terms might sound weird, they are only here to guarantee that the work done behind this tool receives proper credit. If all it takes to make a mod is to learn how to use a tool, then the modder should receive credit for being able to read instructions, not for releasing content that could never be made without the use of those tools.
